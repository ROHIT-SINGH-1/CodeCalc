# WELCOME TO YOUR VS CODE EXTENSION

## WHAT'S IN THE FOLDER

* THIS FOLDER CONTAINS ALL OF THE FILES NECESSARY FOR YOUR EXTENSION.
* `PACKAGE.JSON` - THIS IS THE MANIFEST FILE IN WHICH YOU DECLARE YOUR EXTENSION AND COMMAND.
  * THE SAMPLE PLUGIN REGISTERS A COMMAND AND DEFINES ITS TITLE AND COMMAND NAME. WITH THIS INFORMATION VS CODE CAN SHOW THE COMMAND IN THE COMMAND PALETTE. IT DOESNâ€™T YET NEED TO LOAD THE PLUGIN.
* `SRC/EXTENSION.TS` - THIS IS THE MAIN FILE WHERE YOU WILL PROVIDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOUR COMMAND.
  * THE FILE EXPORTS ONE FUNCTION, `ACTIVATE`, WHICH IS CALLED THE VERY FIRST TIME YOUR EXTENSION IS ACTIVATED (IN THIS CASE BY EXECUTING THE COMMAND). INSIDE THE `ACTIVATE` FUNCTION WE CALL `REGISTERCOMMAND`.
  * WE PASS THE FUNCTION CONTAINING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMAND AS THE SECOND PARAMETER TO `REGISTERCOMMAND`.

## SETUP

* INSTALL THE RECOMMENDED EXTENSIONS (AMODIO.TSL-PROBLEM-MATCHER, MS-VSCODE.EXTENSION-TEST-RUNNER, AND DBAEUMER.VSCODE-ESLINT)


## GET UP AND RUNNING STRAIGHT AWAY

* PRESS `F5` TO OPEN A NEW WINDOW WITH YOUR EXTENSION LOADED.
* RUN YOUR COMMAND FROM THE COMMAND PALETTE BY PRESSING (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` OR `CMD+SHIFT+P` ON MAC) AND TYPING `HELLO WORLD`.
* SET BREAKPOINTS IN YOUR CODE INSIDE `SRC/EXTENSION.TS` TO DEBUG YOUR EXTENSION.
* FIND OUTPUT FROM YOUR EXTENSION IN THE DEBUG CONSOLE.

## MAKE CHANGES

* YOU CAN RELAUNCH THE EXTENSION FROM THE DEBUG TOOLBAR AFTER CHANGING CODE IN `SRC/EXTENSION.TS`.
* YOU CAN ALSO RELOAD (`CTRL+R` OR `CMD+R` ON MAC) THE VS CODE WINDOW WITH YOUR EXTENSION TO LOAD YOUR CHANGES.


## EXPLORE THE API

* YOU CAN OPEN THE FULL SET OF OUR API WHEN YOU OPEN THE FILE `NODE_MODULES/@TYPES/VSCODE/INDEX.D.TS`.

## RUN TESTS

* INSTALL THE [EXTENSION TEST RUNNER](HTTPS://MARKETPLACE.VISUALSTUDIO.COM/ITEMS?ITEMNAME=MS-VSCODE.EXTENSION-TEST-RUNNER)
* RUN THE "WATCH" TASK VIA THE **TASKS: RUN TASK** COMMAND. MAKE SURE THIS IS RUNNING, OR TESTS MIGHT NOT BE DISCOVERED.
* OPEN THE TESTING VIEW FROM THE ACTIVITY BAR AND CLICK THE RUN TEST" BUTTON, OR USE THE HOTKEY `CTRL/CMD + ; A`
* SEE THE OUTPUT OF THE TEST RESULT IN THE TEST RESULTS VIEW.
* MAKE CHANGES TO `SRC/TEST/EXTENSION.TEST.TS` OR CREATE NEW TEST FILES INSIDE THE `TEST` FOLDER.
  * THE PROVIDED TEST RUNNER WILL ONLY CONSIDER FILES MATCHING THE NAME PATTERN `**.TEST.TS`.
  * YOU CAN CREATE FOLDERS INSIDE THE `TEST` FOLDER TO STRUCTURE YOUR TESTS ANY WAY YOU WANT.

## GO FURTHER

* REDUCE THE EXTENSION SIZE AND IMPROVE THE STARTUP TIME BY [BUNDLING YOUR EXTENSION](HTTPS://CODE.VISUALSTUDIO.COM/API/WORKING-WITH-EXTENSIONS/BUNDLING-EXTENSION).
* [PUBLISH YOUR EXTENSION](HTTPS://CODE.VISUALSTUDIO.COM/API/WORKING-WITH-EXTENSIONS/PUBLISHING-EXTENSION) ON THE VS CODE EXTENSION MARKETPLACE.
